    PROBLEM 1: Using the Elements panel of Chrome Dev tools, locate the h1 element and modify its text content to say "Hello, World!". If you refresh the page, does the heading change? 
    */
    // Yes, the heading is changing then returns to original when page is refreshed.
     
    /* 
    PROBLEM 2: Create an h2 element that says "Hello, World" in the HTML above. Using the elements panel again, locate the h1 element and modify its content to say "I'm changing the DOM". If you refresh the page, does the h2 change?
    */
    // The h2 element returns to Hello World after page is refreshed.
    
     /* 
    PROBLEM 3: Create a button element that says "Push me" in the HTML above. Using the Elements panel, locate the button element and add a class of "btn" to it. Style the button by adding custom CSS rules within the Styles panel. Does the button still have the styles after a page refresh? Explain your answer.

    /* 
    PROBLEM 4: Open the Chrome DevTools on any webpage. Using the Elements panel, locate a paragraph element and modify its CSS properties, such as changing the font size, color, or adding a background color. Explain how we are able to make changes on the browser.
